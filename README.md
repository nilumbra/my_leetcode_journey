## Activity log: to a full-year algorithmic trip in Leetcode 
### 2022
### 21st March - 27th March 
To consolidate inputs coming from 6.006 lectures and recitations on dynamic programming, most problems solved this week fell under the DP hood, and most of them are archived under the DP folder. I had a lot of troubles seeing the subproblems/optimal substructures, but now having coded these problems, of same pattern repeatedly, hopefully I won't forget about the black magic too quickly. 

## Analysis

#### Max Island
Isn't this a slightly revised version of floodfill repeated several times?

## TODO  
- [x] Sort solutions into folders by category
