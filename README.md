## Activity log: to a full-year algorithmic trip in Leetcode 
0404 Implement get_neighors(i, j) using JS and Python generator for BFS algorithms in 2D matrix(e.g. 01 Matrix). This should cut memory usage down for a bit.
0403 Figure out a way to optimize space complexity from O(n) to O(1) for the '101' and '010' problem(select building) by drawing a dependency graph. And write the explanation to the problem's discussion panel 
0402 Attend Weekly contest for the first time. Solve only 1 out of 4.
0325 Start using Chrome Extension Leethub to automate uploading leetcode submission to Github 

## Weekly Summary
### 2022
### 21st March - 27th March 
To consolidate inputs coming from 6.006 lectures and recitations on dynamic programming, most problems solved this week fell under the DP hood, and most of them are archived under the DP folder. I had a lot of troubles seeing the subproblems/optimal substructures, but now having coded these problems, of same pattern repeatedly, hopefully I won't forget about the black magic too quickly. 

## Analysis

#### Max Area of Island
Isn't this a slightly revised version of floodfill repeated several times?

## TODO  
- [x] Sort solutions into folders by category
